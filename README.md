DLL files for Windows installation of pi3d
==========================================

Unzip the 32 bit or 64 bit dll files into the main directory of your
python project that's using pi3d.

If your python is 32 bit you need to use the 32 bit dlls and 64 bit for 
64 bit python. You can tell the type of python when you first open an
interactive shell.

i.e. if you downloaded the github pi3d_demos repository to

``C:\Users\another\Documents\GitHub\pi3d_demos-master``

then that's where you would put the three dlls in order to be able to
run the demos.

See general instructions here:

http://pi3d.github.io/html/ReadMe.html#windows

This zip download will be about 5.6MB

NB as a general rule you should ensure that your virus checker gets a sniff
at all .exe and .dll files, including these. I assume they're clean but
I basically just downloaded and compiled the ANGLE project code from

https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/source/checkout
